@0    = ~Hey, you're not from around here!  Yeesh! There's no polish on yer boots, no snap in yer suspenders. You're not merchants.  They're always so much more presentable. Aww nutbunnies, adventurers in Gullykin! Yer gonna loot them Firewine ruins?~
@1    = ~No, I have no interest in ruins.~
@2    = ~Off with you, halfling, I have no patience for your chattering!~
@3    = ~As a matter of fact, yes, I am. Why did you ask?~
@4    = ~I've been to the ruins already, and I must say that they are overrated.~
@5    = ~Wait till you hear what I have to say. These ruins, they are ripe for the pickin' and will be pretty good takin's with none too many bruises.  Maybe we should work together. Stayin' with my aunt here and all, I know this place pretty good, know a few secrets and how to pick a lock or find a booby trap. Could be fun.  What say you?~
@6    = ~A splendid idea!  Welcome aboard.~
@7    = ~I really am sorry but we've all we need.~
@8    = ~Laughable!  What do I need you for? You took up enough of my time, now get lost!~
@9    = ~Well!  There's no need to be rude about it!  Hmph!  Never meet nice people in this line of work!  No wonder people hate adventurers!  Goodbye!~
@10   = ~Double good and done!  Oh, it's great fun having someone from the trade to talk to! I'm here stayin' with my aunt, to mend my ways and all, but I'm growin' just a little bit bored. Maybe we should work together. I know this place pretty good; know a few secrets, how to pick a lock or find a booby trap.  Could be fun.  What say you?~
@11   = ~Holy Kitty Cacophony, overrated?! Now this *is* exciting!  We should. . .we should work together!  Yeah!  I could use the help. . .uh.  .I mean, we could just help each other a little bit.  I can scout out the pretties for you. You can even keep most of it! Whatcha say?~
@12   = ~Friends we are, and nice ones too!  One for all and things like that!  Fun for all of us, I just *know* it!~
@13   = ~Ah well, easy go I guess.  Never get to make any friends in this biz.  Specially the nice ones.  Bye, I guess.~
@14   = ~I guess I'll just mope around here 'till you come back to your senses and come back for me.~
@15   = ~Well if your gonna be puppy-doggin after me all <DAYNIGHT>, maybe we should work together.~
